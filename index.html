        <p class="lead mb-4">My name is Joanne Son and I am currently an undergraduate at University of California, Riverside. I will be graduating in the Spring of 2023 with a Bachelorâ€™s of Science in General Biology. The next few years I plan to work to gain experience in a clinical setting. My goal is to apply to physician assistant programs around the state of California and to become a physician assistant in the Los Angeles Area. I want to become a physician assistant because of its teamwork aspect and the intimate relationship they can have with each patient. I believe physician assistants are essential for patients to feel like they are getting the special care they need. Additionally, I like the fact that they work with one another and have a doctor to help guide them. I was born and raised in Los Angeles, California to Korean parents who immigrated in the 1990s. Growing up I saw them never going to the hospital because of the expensive bills and struggling to understand their diagnosis because of the lack of bilingual providers. 
As I receive more education in the healthcare field, I wish to be a provider to underserved communities in Southern California and all around the world. 
<br><br>

        I have been part of and serving in an organization called Global Medical Missions Alliance for the past 4 years. This organizationâ€™ purpose is to build Christian healthcare workers of the next generation and work to partner with different communities worldwide. With this organization we have done many community and global outreach projects to help the underserved communities. We got the opportunity to provide medical and education support. By serving as President, missions coordinator, and secretary the past three years I learned how to lead and work with others as a team. I have been able to serve in Mexico and Honduras with Global Medical Missions Alliance. I got the chance to learn how to take blood pressure, communicate even with language barriers, and engage children. To grow my research and technical abilities I joined a neuroscience lab the past year. The project I am working on is how different stimuli affect the physiological change of mice. Through this opportunity, I learned different lab techniques like suturing and doing PCR. Moreover I learned how to be more independent, apply materials learned in class to research, and the importance of precision. During my undergraduate years, I also continued my studies in Spanish. In order to provide more inclusive care to each patient, I want to be able to speak multiple languages. Currently I can fluently speak Spanish and Korean. <br><br>

        As a healthcare provider, I want to be able to provide the best care to my patients that I can. I wish to serve the underserved communities that do not get this care. Additionally, I want to focus on educating these communities how to maintain physical well being and how to stay healthy. I believe education is the best way to help communities become more self-sustaining and independent.
